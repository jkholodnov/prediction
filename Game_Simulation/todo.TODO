 ☐ Scheduler do not context switch until a thread completes its course of execution. EG:
  int x=0;
   x = thread->execute(somefunction);

   int somefunction(someparams){
     asdf;
     return 1;
   }

   while(x =0){
    continue to allow thread to use the core. //will this cause performance hit due to IO bound process?
   }
